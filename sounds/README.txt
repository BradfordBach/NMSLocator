This folder contains the notifications that play when you are logging black holes.

You can replace the wav files with your own if you wish to customize it, or you can delete or rename them if you do not want certain notifications.

All sounds are open source, but I want to thank Kastenfrosch for creating these sounds.  You can find his work at
